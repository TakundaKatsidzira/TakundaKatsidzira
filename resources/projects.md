## PYTHON PROJECTS

## üß† **0. Define and Understand the Problem**
 
* Identify inputs, outputs, data, processes.
* Break the solution into minimal sub-tasks to implement one by one.
* For each problem experiment with small examples, testable procedures to come up with a solution.
* Design a procedural algorithm to solve the problem handling edge cases, and constraints.
* Develop a working solution first, can be suboptimal, test and validate solution.
* Incrementally optimize complexity.

## üß± **1. Object-Oriented Design**

* Branch 
* Analyze your procedural code to identify natural objects and behaviors.
* Define classes, methods, and attributes based on problem domain entities.
* Refactor procedural functions into class methods.
* Apply encapsulation and modularize code.
* Use class relationships like inheritance or composition where appropriate.
* Design to optimize for maintanence reuse and testing.
* Develop a working OOP product.

## üìê **2. Optimize and Refactor**

* Branch
* Optimize algorithms and data structures where possible.
* Review your OOP design and refactor according to SOLID and DRY principles:
* Identify common design problems in your project.
* Learn and apply appropriate design patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator, Composite, State, etc.).
* Branch and experiment with trade-offs introduced by design patterns.
* Refactor code for readability, performance, scalability, and reliability.
