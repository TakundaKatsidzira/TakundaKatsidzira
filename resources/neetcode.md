## **PROBLEM SOLVING STEPS**

### üß† **0. Understand the Problem**

* **Read carefully** ‚Äî more than once.
* **Identify input and output.**
* Ask yourself:
  * What are the **constraints**?
  * Are there **edge cases** (e.g. empty arrays, nulls, max/min values)?
* **Rephrase** the problem in your own words.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **1. Work Through Examples**

* Use **example and test cases** given in the problem.
* **Experiment with your own examples, tests and edge cases.**
* **Manually work through** for a few examples and test cases.
* **Take notes** of anything interesting. 

### üß© **2. Identify the Problem Type**

* Go through **everything youve been given, know and discovered.**
* Based on info, **recall common patterns/techniques**.
* **Find categories of data structures and algorithms** that can be mapped to the problem:
  * Array, String, Hashmap, Tree, Graph, DP, Greedy, etc.

### üß± **3. Plan a Strategy (High-Level Approach)**

* Can you do it **brute force**? if yes work through brute force.
* Take notes of anything interesting new **edge cases repetitions patterns in brute force.**
* Think of possible **optimizations**.
* **Come up with multiple solutions.** 
* Pick **optimal solution**
* Consider:
  * **Time complexity: O(n), O(log n), etc.**
  * **Space complexity: constant, linear, etc.**

### ‚úèÔ∏è **4. Write Pseudocode or Comments First**

* **Break the logic into clear steps.**
* Helps reduce syntax errors and **guide implementation**.
* Start with **comments on inputs, outputs, steps in solution.**

### ‚å®Ô∏è **5. Code the Solution**

* Translate **pseudocode into actual code.**
* Stick to **clean, readable code** with good variable names.
* Write helper functions if needed.
* **Use examples and test cases to check logic as you go.**
* Use **print statements and debuggers if necessary.**
* Clean up code: remove print statements, rename vars.
* Add comments for clarity (especially if the solution is not obvious).


### üßπ **6. Analyze and Optimize**

* **State Time and Space complexity of your solution.**
* Look at **alternate best time  best space solutions**. 
* **Learn and implement** them by yourself.


## **STUCK**

* If stuck for more than 15 minutes, look up solution.
* Take note if whats missing is small and try again.
* Else learn solution as is and note any topics and concepts youre unfamiliar with.
* At your discretion decide if you want to deep dive into any of these topics.
* If topic is foundational to all the following deep dive else get to it when it comes up again.
* If frustrated take a break touch grass and come back.
