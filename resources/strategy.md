# PROBLEM SOLVING

# Health Fisrt

* Don’t let frustration build.
* If you’re stuck or angry, step away—touch grass, hydrate, take a walk.
* Celebrate small wins.
* Be patient.
* Skills compound over time with deliberate practice.

# Strategy

* Work within timed sprints.
* 45 minute rounds, 15 minute break.
* 45 minutes to understand, Plan, Solve and Reflect and a 15 minute break to review and rest.
* If stuck the next round can be used to learn the solution and try implement and experiment with it yourself.
* for recurring mistakes and roadblocks use a round to study the material required.
* Revisit problems you couldn't solve, either later or after reviewing material and similar easier problems.

# 0. Understand

* Read the problem statement thoroughly.
* Study the examples carefully.
* Re-read the problem.
* Identify inputs, outputs, edge cases and contsraints.
* Ask clarifying questions.
* Work through given and custom examples cases manually.
* Take note of key information, patterns, ideas and edge cases. 

# 1. Plan.

* Formulate a basic approach first.
* Focus on correctness not efficiency.
* Comment the logic in plain language or pseudocode. Think out loud in comments.
* Look for patterns that you can map to categories and key data structures and algorithms to optimize.
* Evaluate your naive solution and try to optimize it step-by-step.
* Consider multiple approaches and the trade offs in performance and readability 
* Analyze the time and space complexity of each approach and pick an optimal one you can implement.

# 2. Solve.

* Write pseudocode for step-by-step logic.
* Walk through your pseudocode with examples to validate logic.
* Confirm solution with by tracing test cases and sampleinput.
* Code following your psuedocode.
* Use clear and descriptive variable names.
* Write helper functions if needed.
* Trace and test as you go, then run through code with examples before submission.
* Debug as needed, refactor and clean up code.

# 3. Reflect

* If your solution is accepted, Review logic and analyze complexity.
* Review other approaches comparing complexity.
* Take note of anything new learnt.
* If solution failed, study solution, review background material and study unfamiliar concepts.
* Take note of where you went off and find other commmon mistakes you could have made.
* Mark question for later attempt.
