#### Notes on  PROBLEM SOLVING and LEARNING

### Practical Learning 

* Start with a problem from Projects ,Leetcode, Textbooks or Course. 
* Attempt it on your own, and struggle for a little bit of time to come up with your own solution.
* When stuck look up solution through availale solutions, answers sections or AI and study it until you understand it.
* Research and study relevant fundamentals, concepts techniques, tools and anything new encountered.
* Look into textbooks, short and long form video and AI explanations. 
* Retry problem and repeat previous steps until you can come up with your own solution. 
* Look for similar problems and see if solution can be generalized or modified to work on them.
* Document new information in journal and take notes of patterns tevhniques and tools for future problems.
* As much repetition and time on a topic as possible and Move on as needed.

#### PROJECTS

For **Python engineering projects**, focused on **beginner to advanced levels**, emphasizing **programming fundamentals, OOP, testing, and debugging**:

## 🧠 **1. Understand and Define the Problem**

*  Restate the problem in your own words. Identify inputs, outputs, edge, cases and constraints .
*  Think in terms of modules, classes and functions.
*  Break the problem into sub-tasks.
*  Document requirements in tools and data. 

## 📚 **2. Gather tools and information**

*  Start from what you already know and immediately think off and build on that.
*  Research and Analyze topics fill in gaps.
*  Collect tools and learn relevant tools and techniques.
*  Sketch or simulate ideas for clarity.
*  Brainstorm possible solutions without judging them initially.
*  Consider failure modes or previous unsuccessful approaches.
*  Document data, ideas and information.


### 📉 **3. Analyze and Select the Best Solution**

* Evaluate ideas using criteria like feasibility, complexity, reliability, scalability and efficiency, .
* Consider trade-offs and perform risk assessment.

### 🏗️ **4. Design and Develop**

* Create detailed designs and schematics for modules classes functions, UML diagrams and flowcharts.
* Design MVP, prototypes or models as needed.
* Use version control and design documentation best practices.

### 📈 **5. Implement and Debug**

* Develop the final solution in steps completing task by task.
* Test and debug incrementally .
* Build feedback loops with prints logs and tests

### 🧪 **6. Test and Validate**

* Test against the original requirements and constraints.
* Test Performance and scalability.
* Iterate as necessary to improve performance or reliability.

## 📦 **7. Refactor and Optimize**

* Remove redundant code and improve variable names.
* Refactor large functions into smaller ones, apply type hints, add comments/docstrings and format.

## 📄 **8. Document and Deliver**

* **Beginner**: Comment and Document your code clearly.
* **Medium**: Write docstrings for functions and classes.
* **Advanced**: Create README files, doc folders, and optionally auto-generate docs 

#### FOR LEETCODE


### 🔧 **1. Understand the Problem Clearly **

* **Read the full problem statement carefully, three times.**
* Identify:

  * **Input format**
  * **Output format**
  * **Constraints**
  * **Edge cases**
  * Go through examples and understan problem flow.
  * Rephrase problem, remove redundant information, abstract and break problem into tasks.
  
---

### 📊 **2. Gather Information (Analyze Examples)**

* Study provided examples and work them out manually.
* Identify patterns in inputs/outputs.
* Start from what you already know and build
* Ask questions like:
* Existing tools functions and libraries to use.
* Input Validation 
* Think about:
  
  * Time and space constraints.
  * Possible brute force solutions.
  * Common data structures and algorithms for this type of data or problem and common patterns 
---

### 🧠 **3. Generate Multiple Concepts (Brainstorm Approaches)**

* Consider different solution strategies:

  * Brute force
  * Optimize for time
  * Optimize for space
  * Visualize sketch out and play with ideas


### 📉 **4. Analyze and Select the Best Solution**

* Compare time/space complexity of your ideas.
* Choose the simplest efficient solution.
* Check edge cases: empty input, very large inputs, duplicates, etc.

### 🏗️ **5. Design and Develop**

* Start with a function signature.
* Write clean, modular code.
* Use helper functions if needed.
* Follow naming conventions.
* Use comments for clarity if needed.
* Build incrementally—don’t write everything before testing.

### 🧪 **6. Test and Validate**

* Use all provided test cases.
* Add your own:

  * Edge cases   * Corner cases (repeats, unordered input)
* Use print/debug statements or IDE debugger if needed.

### 📈 **7. Submit Revise, and Document
* Submit the solution.
* Review:

  * Time complexity (Runtime in %)
  * Memory usage
  * Compare with other top solutions for learning new tricks.
  * Document techniques applies and new material learnt. 
  * Note down key takeaways in a LeetCode journal or flashcards.



### 🔄 **8. Reflect, Refactor and Improve**

* Ask:

  * Did I solve it efficiently?
  * Could I have done it with less code or cleaner logic?
  * What similar problems can I try next?
